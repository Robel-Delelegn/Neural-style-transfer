# Neural Style Transfer

## Description
This project implements neural style transfer, a technique that applies the artistic style of one image to the content of another. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve this effect, enabling the creation of visually stunning images.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
Navigate to the project directory.

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
Ensure you have Python and pip installed, then install the necessary packages.

3. **Run the neural style transfer**:
Use the provided script to apply the style transfer.

Replace the paths with your actual file locations of your content and style images.

## Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" by *Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge*. The implementation follows the techniques and methodologies described in their work.
